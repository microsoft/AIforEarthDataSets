# NOAA Global Hydro Estimator

## Overview

Global rainfall estimates in 15-minute intervals.

The NOAA [Global Hydro Estimator](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/atmosphere/ghe/index.html) (GHE) program produces estimates of global (between -60° and +60° latitude) precipitation every 15 minutes, at ~4km resolution.  Estimates are derived from satellite imagery and data from NOAA's [Global Forecast System](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs); details about the GHE algorithm are available [here](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/atmosphere/ghe/algo.html).

This dataset is available on Azure thanks to the [NOAA Big Data Program](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/big-data-program).


## Storage resources

Data are stored in blobs in gzip'd [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) format in the East US data center, in the following blob container:

`https://ghe.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-ghe`

Within that container, data are named as:

`[product]/[year]/[month]/[day]/[filename]`

* <i>product</i> is a product name; this should always be "rainfall"
* <i>year</i> is a four-digit year
* <i>month</i> is a two-digit month-of-year code, starting with 01
* <i>day</i> is a two-digit day-of-month code, starting with 01
* <i>filename</i> encodes the product, date, and time, with the last four digits encoding 24-hour time on 15-minute boundaries

For example, this filename:

`https://ghe.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-ghe/rain_rate/2020/04/02/NPR.GEO.GHE.v1.S202004020030.nc.gz`

...contains the 15-minute rainfall estimate for April 2, 2020, at 00:30 UTC.

Latitude and longitude are not perfectly uniformly sampled, so an additional file is available to specify the precise lat/lon grid associated with all GHE files (~160MB):

<https://ghe.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-ghe/NPR.GEO.GHE.v1.Navigation.netcdf.gz>

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access to GHE data via, e.g., BlobFuse, which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`?sv=2020-04-08&si=noaa-ghe-ro&sr=c&sig=q9K1gGIRSmhbDcm27PEXo%2F%2BYGK8%2BkYhuiCJvZbOPdOs%3D`

Mounting instructions for Linux are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux).

Large-scale processing using this dataset is best performed in the East US Azure data center, where the data is stored.


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting a GHE image (i.e., an instantaneous global estimate) is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/ghe.ipynb).
