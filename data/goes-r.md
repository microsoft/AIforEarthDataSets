# NOAA GOES-R

## Overview

Weather imagery from the GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites.

The [GOES-R](https://www.goes-r.gov/) (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) program images weather phenomena from a set of satellites in geostationary orbits.  The GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites are the first two of four planned GOES-R satellites.

This dataset currently includes eleven level-2 products from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument, and one level-2 product from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instrument.  We may on-board other GOES-16 and GOES-17 products on request; please contact [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=goes%20question) if you are interested in using additional GOES data on Azure.

This dataset is available on Azure thanks to the [NOAA Big Data Program](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/big-data-program).

GOES-R data is also available as a collection in the [Planetary Computer Data Catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/goes-cmi).

## Storage resources

Data are available in Blob Storage in the West Europe Azure data center<sup>1</sup>, in both [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) and [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) (COG) format.

NetCDF files (one file per scene) are available in the following containers, for GOES-16 and GOES-17 respectively:

`https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes16`<br/>
`https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes17`

COG files (one file per band) are available in the following folders, for GOES-16 and GOES-17 respectively:

`https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes-cogs/goes-16/`<br/>
`https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes-cogs/goes-17/`

Within any of the above, data are named as:

`[product]/[year]/[day]/[hour]/[filename]`

* <i>product</i> is a product name, see the [storage resources page](https://github.com/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/goes-r.md#storage-resources) for a list of available products
* <i>year</i> is a four-digit year
* <i>day</i> is a three-digit day-of-year code, starting with 001
* <i>hour</i> is a two-digit hour-of-day code, starting with 00
* <i>filename</i> encodes the product, date, and time; details are available in the [GOES Users' Guide](https://www.goes-r.gov/products/docs/PUG-L2%2B-vol5.pdf)

For example, this file:

https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes16/ABI-L2-MCMIPF/2020/003/00/OR_ABI-L2-MCMIPF-M6_G16_s20200030000215_e20200030009534_c20200030010031.nc

...contains data from January 3, 2020, between midnight and 1am UTC (hour 00).

This is the prefix for the same scene in COG format:

https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes16/ABI-L2-MCMIPF/2020/003/00/OR_ABI-L2-MCMIPF-M6_G16_s20200030000215_e20200030009534_c20200030010031

...and this is the COG file representing the first band from that scene:

https://goeseuwest.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes16/ABI-L2-MCMIPF/2020/003/00/OR_ABI-L2-MCMIPF-M6_G16_s20200030000215_e20200030009534_c20200030010031_CMI_C01.tif

Data channels and wavelengths are described [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/satellite-data/goes-r-series-satellites/glossary).

Large-scale processing using this dataset is best performed in the West Europe Azure data center, where the data is stored.

### East US subset

<sup>1</sup>The following products are also available in the East US Azure data center, in NetCDF format:

* GOES-16 ABI-L1b-RadF
* GOES-16 ABI-L2-MCMIPF
* GOES-16 and GOES-17 GLM-L2-LCFA

Storage containers for this subset are as follows:

`https://goes.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes16`<br/>
`https://goes.blob.core.windows.net/noaa-goes17`


## Authentication

NetCDF files do not require authentication; COG files require a [Shared Access Signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) token, available via our [Planetary Computer token API](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/).


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting a GOES-16 image is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/goes-r-abi-l2-mcmipf.ipynb).
