# NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS)

## Overview

The NOAA [Global Forecast System](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gfs.php) (GFS) is a global numerical weather prediction system containing a global computer model and variational analysis run by the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS). The model is divided into 127 vertical layers extending from the surface to the mesopause (~80km).   The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 13 kilometers between grid points. The GFS is run operationally four times a day and produces forecasts for up to 16 days in advance. Hundreds Of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. 

The current operational GFS is an atmospheric model coupled to a near sea surface temperature model (NSST) over the ocean and lakes, a thermodynamic ice model,  and a land/soil model elsewhere.   Changes are regularly made to the GFS to improve its performance and forecast accuracy. It is a constantly evolving and improving weather prediction model.

Data are retained for 30 days.

This dataset is available on Azure thanks to the [NOAA Big Data Program](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/big-data-program).


## Storage resources

Data are stored primarily in [GRIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB) format.

GRIB files are stored as blobs in the East US Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://noaagfs.blob.core.windows.net/gfs`

Within that container, top-level folders are named as:

`[product].[date]`

* `product` is one of:
  * `gfs`: forecast data from the [Global Forecast System](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/#GFS) (GFS)
  * `gdas`: forecast data gridded with the [Global Data Assimilation System](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-data-assimilation-system-gdas) (GDAS)
  * `gfsmos`: model output statistics from the [GFS MOS](https://www.weather.gov/mdl/mos_gfsmos_home) suite
  * `sst`: sea surface temperature forecasts produced by the [NCEP Sea Surface Temperature](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/sst/) (SST) models
  * `enkfgdas`: data assimilated using the [GSI Hybrid/4DEnVar Data Assimilation](https://dtcenter.ucar.edu/com-GSI/users/docs/presentations/2017_tutorial/D3-L12_GSI_Hybrid4DEnVarDA_Kleist.pdf) system
  
* `date` is the model execution date in YYYYMMDD format

File format within a folder varies by product; documentation for the primary products (GFS and GFS-GDAS) can be found at:

* [GFS](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/#GFS)
* [GFS-GDAS](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/#GDAS)


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the East US Azure region, where the data are 


## Mounting the container

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access via, e.g., [BlobFuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse), which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:
