# Sentinel-5P

## Overview

The [Sentinel-5P](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p) mission provides daily global atmospheric measurements at a resolution of 3.5km x 7km on most bands.

This dataset represents the global archive of Sentinel-5P [Level 2](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/level-2-products) products, from 2018 to the present, in NetCDF format.

Sentinel-5P data on Azure are maintained by [Sinergise](https://sinergise.com/).

Sentinel-5P data are currently in preview on Azure; email [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=sentinel5p%20question) to request access.


## Storage resources

### Container information

Data are stored as NetCDF files in Azure Blob Storage in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://sentinel5euwest.blob.core.windows.net/sentinel-5p`


### Scene names

Within that container, each scene corresponds to a folder, named according to:

`TROPOMI/[product]/[year]/[month]/[day]/[scene_name]`

* `product` is a product identifier, one of:
  * `L2__AER_AI`: UV aerosol index
  * `L2__AER_LH`: Aerosol layer height
  * `L2__CH4___`: Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)
  * `L2__CLOUD_`: Cloud
  * `L2__CO____`: Carbon monoxide (CO)
  * `L2__HCHO__`: Formaldehyde (HCHO)
  * `L2__NO2___`: Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub)
  * `L2__O3____`: Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>
  * `L2__O3_TCL`: Tropospheric ozone
  * `L2__SO2___`: Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)
  * `L2__NP_BD3`: Cloud from the [Suomi NPP](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html) mission, band 3
  * `L2__NP_BD6`: Cloud from the [Suomi NPP](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html) mission, band 6
  * `L2__NP_BD7`: Cloud from the [Suomi NPP](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html) mission, band 7
* `year` is the four-digit year
* `month` is the 1-indexed, zero-padded month
* `day` is the 1-indexed, zero-padded day of month

`scene name` follows the [Sentinel-5P file name convention](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/documents/247904/2506504/FFS-Tailoring-Sentinel-5P.pdf):

* `S5P` is the mission indicator (Sentinel-5P)
* `CCCC` is a file class, one of:
  * `NRTI` (near-real-time processing)
  * `OFFL` (offline processing)
  * `RPRO` (reprocessed) (uncommon)
* `L2` indicates level-2 data
* `PPPPPPPPPP` is a ten-character product identifier, matching the `product` field above
* `yyyymmddThhmmss` is the sensing start time for this scene (`T` is the character 'T')
* `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` is the sensing stop time for this scene (`T` is the character 'T')
* `oooooo` is an absolute orbit number
* `cc` is a collection number (always 01)
* `pppppp` is the version number of the toolkit used to produce the L2 product`
* `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` is a processing date and time

Putting that all together, the following is a complete URL to a methane product from Jan 5, 2021:

`https://sentinel5euwest.blob.core.windows.net/sentinel-5p/TROPOMI/L2__CH4___/2021/01/05/S5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20210105T001436_20210105T015606_16736_01_010400_20210106T172254/`


### Image files

Each scene folder contains a single NetCDF file whose name matches the scene name; for example, the above folder contains one file called:

`S5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20210105T001436_20210105T015606_16736_01_010400_20210106T172254.nc`


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting Sentinel-5P data is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/sentinel-5p.ipynb).


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure region, where the images are stored.
