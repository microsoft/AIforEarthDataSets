# Sentinel-1 SLC

## Overview

The [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) program provides global synthetic aperture radar imaging with a revisit time of approximately six days.  The [Single Look Complex](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-1-sar/products-algorithms/level-1-algorithms/single-look-complex) (SLC) product includes images in the slant range, in the plane in which images are acquired.

This dataset represents the most recent 90 days of the Sentinel-1 SLC archive, in the [SAFE](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/data-formats/safe-specification) format in which images are provided by the European Space Agency.

Sentinel-1 data on Azure are maintained by [Sinergise](https://sinergise.com/).

Sentinel-1 SLC data is currently in preview on Azure; email [`aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com`](mailto:aiforearthdatasets@microsoft.com?subject=sentinel1%20question) to request access.

We also maintain a complete archive of Sentinel-1 GRD data, in cloud-optimized format; see the [GRD documentation](https://aka.ms/ai4edata-sentinel-1).

## Storage resources

### Container information

Data are stored in blobs in the West Europe Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://sentinelintake.blob.core.windows.net/s1-slc`


### Scene names

Within that container, each scene corresponds to a folder, named according to:

`SLC/[year]/[month]/[day]/[acquisition-mode]/[polarization]/[scene_name]`

* `year` is a four-digit year
* `month` is the 1-indexed, non-zero-padded month
* `day` is the 1-indexed, non-zero-padded day
* `acquisition-mode` is the [acquisition mode](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes) for this scene, one of IW (interferometric wide swath), SM (stripmap), EW (extra-wide swath), or WV (wave)
* `polarization` is the [polarization mode](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/product-overview/polarimetry) for this scene, typically one of SH (single HH), SV (single VV), DH (dual HH+HV), or DV (dual VV+VH); HH, HV, VV, and VH also occur

`scene name` follows the [Sentinel-1 scene name convention](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-1-sar/products-algorithms/level-1-product-formatting):

`MMM_BB_TTTR_LFPP_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_YYYYMMDDYHHMMSS_OOOOOO_DDDDDD_CCCC`

* `MMM` is satellite (S1A or S1B)
* `BB` is the acquisition mode
* `TTT` is the product type (always `GRD` in this data set)
* `L` is the processing level (always `1` in this data set)
* `F` is the product class (always `S` (for "SAR standard") in this dataset)
* `PP` is the polarization (SH, SV, DH, DV, HH, HV, VV, or VH)
* `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` is the scene start and stop capture time
* `OOOOOO` is an absolute orbit number
* `DDDDDD` is the "mission data take identifier" 
* `CCCC` is a checksum

Putting that all together, a complete scene file looks like:

`https://sentinelintake.blob.core.windows.net/s1-slc/SLC/2021/10/7/IW/SH/S1A_IW_SLC__1SSH_20211007T012134_20211007T012201_040006_04BC4B_7D74.zip`


### Data archiving

Scenes older than 90 days are stored in the same container, but have been retired to [Azure archive storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/archive/#overview).  Those scenes will still be enumerated when listing blobs in the container, but they will not be readable with read-only access tokens.


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the West Europe Azure region, where the images are stored.
