# NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)

## Overview

The NOAA [HRRR](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/hrrr/) is a real-time 3km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-hour period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced [Rapid Refresh](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/) (RAP) system.

This dataset is available on Azure thanks to the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD)](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination).


## Storage resources

Data are stored in [GRIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB) format; within each GRIB file are both data and [Climate and Forecast v1.6 metadata](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html).

GRIB files are stored as blobs in the East US Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://noaahrrr.blob.core.windows.net/hrrr`

Within that container, files are named as:

`HRRR.[year][month][day]/[region]/hrrr.t[CC]z.[variable]f[FH].grib2`

* `year` is a four-digit year
* `month` is a two-digit month (one-indexed)
* `day` is a two-digit day (one-indexed)
* `region` can be either "conus" or "alaska"
* `CC` is the cycle run hour (00 to 23)
* `variable` is the output variable (wrfprsf, wrfnatf, wrfsfcf, or wrfsubhf; see the [HRRR documentation](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/hrrr/) for definitions)
* `FH` represents the forecast hour (00 to 18 for standard cycles, 00 to 48 for extended-forecast cycles (00, 06, 12, 18))

For example, for the file:

`hrrr.20141201/conus/hrrr.t18z.wrfsubhf15.grib2`

* Year: 2014
* Month: 12
* Day: 01
* Region: conus
* CC (cycle run): 18
* Variable: wrfsubh
* FH (forecast hour): 15


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and plotting HRRR data is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/noaa-hrrr.ipynb).


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the East US Azure region, where the data are stored.


## Mounting the container

We also provide an API to get read-only SAS (shared access signature) tokens to allow access via, e.g., [BlobFuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse), which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:

`https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/sas/v1/token/noaahrrr/hrrr`

API documentation is at `https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/sas/v1/docs`.
Mounting instructions for Linux are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-how-to-mount-container-linux).
