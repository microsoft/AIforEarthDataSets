# NOAA Rapid Refresh (RAP)

## Overview

The NOAA [Rapid Refresh](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rap/) (RAP) is a NOAA/NCEP operational weather prediction system comprised primarily of a numerical forecast model and analysis/assimilation system to initialize that model. It covers North America and is run with a horizontal resolution of 13 km and 50 vertical layers. The RAP was developed to serve users needing frequently updated short-range weather forecasts, including those in the US aviation community and US severe weather forecasting community. The model is run for every hour of the day; it is integrated to 51 hours for the 03/09/15/21 UTC cycles and to 21 hours for every other cycle. The RAP uses the ARW core of the [WRF model](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) and the [Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation](https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/gridpoint-statistical-interpolation-gsi) (GSI) analysis.  The analysis is aided with the assimilation of cloud and hydrometer data to improve short-range cloud and precipitation forecasts.

Data are retained for 30 days.

This dataset is available on Azure thanks to the [NOAA Big Data Program](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/big-data-program).


## Storage resources

Data are stored in [GRIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB) format.

GRIB files are stored as blobs in the East US Azure region, in the following blob container:

`https://noaarap.blob.core.windows.net/rap`

Within that container, files are named as:

`rap.[year][month][day]/[product][year][month][day]/rap.t[CC]z.[variable]f[FH].grib2`

* `year` is a four-digit year
* `month` is a two-digit month (one-indexed)
* `day` is a two-digit day (one-indexed)
* `CC` is the cycle run hour (00 to 23)
* `variable` is the output variable (awp130pgrb awp252prgb, awp236prgb, awp130bgrb, awp252brgb, awip32, awp242, awp200, awp243, wrfmsl, wrfprs, or wrfnat); see the [RAP documentation](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rap/) for definitions)
* `FH` represents the forecast hour (00 to 21 for standard cycles, 00 to 51 for extended-forecast cycles (03, 09, 15, 21))

For example, for the file:

<https://noaarap.blob.core.windows.net/rap/rap.20211013/rap.t00z.awip32f01.grib2>

* Year: 2021
* Month: 10
* Day: 13
* CC (cycle run): 00
* Variable: awip32
* FH (forecast hour): 01


## Region information

Large-scale processing is best performed in the East US Azure region, where the data are stored.


## Mounting the container

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access via, e.g., [BlobFuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse), which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:
